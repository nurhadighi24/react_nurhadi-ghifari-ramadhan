Based on the combination of pop, R&B, and K-pop, I would associate the color palette with a vibrant and dynamic range. The colors that come to mind are bright poppy pink, electric blue, and sleek silver. These colors reflect the energetic and catchy nature of pop music, the smooth and soulful elements of R&B, and the fashionable and modern vibe of K-pop.
